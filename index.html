            <p class="bold">Lemon Land is BACK<br> 9th-11th September 2022</p>

            <p>We’re extremely pleased to announce the return of our flagship festival event to squeeze the last bit of juice out of the summer! Featuring all things Lemon Lounge - expect the towering weight of the LL sound system, delicious food, lemon
                affiliated DJs & live music, and of course zesty activities, all in a beautiful chalk valley near Winchester</p>

            <p>🐃🐃🐃</p>

            <p>Last year was on a Bison Farm, and continuing on the theme, this year we’ve found a very nice Buffalo farm to host our zestivities. And before you ask… Buffalo tours will be happening, keep em peeled.</p>

            <p>If you happened to join us last year, then you’ll know the score as we’re going to operate on a similar format:</p>

            <p><span class="bold">Friday (from 3pm)</span><br>Big communal welcoming dinner, a themed pot luck + firing up the sound<br><br>
                <span class="bold">Saturday</span><br>Big sound system day and into the night<br> <br> <span class="bold">Sunday</span><br>Big live music and general zesty occurrences day. Please do stay Sunday night for the Sacrifice and head off Monday
                morning by 12pm</p>
            <br>
            <p>As before, it’s an intimate affair. We’re only selling 150 or so tickets to keep it nice and friendly. We’re keeping it as invite and friends of invitees only to keep it manageable so please send us a message if you’d like to come with a big
                group. Last year worked so well in the sense that we all felt like one big family by the end of the weekend and we’d really like to do that again</p>

            <p>🥕🥕🥕</p>

            <p>Food-wise the Buffalo farm itself will be providing catering for breakfast lunch and dinner. We’re v. excited to partner with them as they’ve got a really varied menu and it’s literally as sustainable as you can get - most of the produce is
                grown on site so will be travelling less than a mile to our mouths. The lemon crew will be providing the bar as per last year. Queen Mezza on the lemon cocktails 👑</p>

            <p>We’ve tried to price it fairly at £65 - we’re not pretending to have all the bells and whistles of a larger festival, but still good vibes are 100% guaranteed. Our aim here is purely to break even. If the ticket price is a barrier for you
                but you would really like to come please get in touch!</p>

            <p>There is a glamping Yurt camp available too that sleeps 6 people. Hit us up to arrange that for an extra cost</p>

            <p>🚗🚗🚗</p>

            <p>Travel-wise, if you’re driving we’ll send an exact pin drop out nearer the time, it’s in Stockbridge which is a 2hr drive from SE London and a 1hr30 drive from Bristol. Please do car share if you can!</p>

            <p>If you’ll be getting the train, head to Andover which is the nearest well connected station, and we will arrange some shuttles to pick people up</p>

            <p>More details and lineup coming to your inbox very soon after you grab a ticket</p>

            <p class="bold">LEMON LOVE WE CAN’T WAIT TO SEE YOU</p>
