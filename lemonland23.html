          Wiltshire
        </p>

        <p class="emoji">🐃🐃🐃</p>

        <p>
          If you happened to join us a few years ago, then you’ll know the score
          as we’re going to operate in a similar format + a few extras
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="bold">Friday (from 3pm)</span><br />Big communal
          welcoming dinner, a themed pot luck + firing up the sound system<br /><br />
          <span class="bold">Saturday</span><br />Big sound system day and into
          the night, some live music around the bonfire and some workshops<br />
          <br />
          <span class="bold">Sunday</span><br />Big live music and general zesty

        <br />
        <p>
          As before, it’s an intimate affair. We’re only selling 200 or so
          tickets to keep it nice and friendly. It will be friends and friends
          of friends to keep it manageable so please send us a message if you’d
          like to come with a big group. It worked so well before in the sense
          that we all felt like kinsfolk by the end of the weekend and we’d
          really like to do that again
        </p>

        <p class="emoji">🥕🥕🥕</p>

        <p>
          Food-wise we have enlisted the help of some tasty traders to keep us
          fed. The lemon crew will be providing the bar as per last time. Queen
          Mezza on the lemon cocktails.
        </p>

        <p class="emoji">👑</p>

        <p>
          We’ve tried to price it fairly at £75 - we’re not pretending to have
          all the bells and whistles of a larger festival, but still good vibes
          are guaranteed. Our aim here is purely to break even. If the ticket
          price is a barrier for you but you would really like to come please
          get in touch!
        </p>

        <p>
          There is a little apartment on site also that sleeps 4 people. Hit us
          up to arrange that for an extra cost
        </p>

        <p>
          Travel-wise, if you’re driving we’ll send an exact pin drop out nearer
          the time, it’s in a small village near Warminster which is a 2hr 30min
          drive from SE London and a 1hr30 drive from Bristol. Please do car
          share if you can!
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’ll be getting the train, head to Gillingham, Dorset which is
          the nearest well connected station, it will be a cheap taxi from there
          to the site. There is a direct train from Waterloo which takes 2hr
        </p>

        <p>
          More details and lineup coming to your inbox very soon after you grab
          a ticket
        </p>
