          Lemon Land is BACK<br />
          5-7th September 2025
        </p>

        <p>Hello Lemons,</p>

        <p>
          We‚Äôre extremely pleased to announce the return of our very own
          festival to bring up the rear of summer ‚Äô25.
        </p>

        <p>
          Featuring all things Lemon Lounge - the towering weight of the sound
          system, delicious food, lemon affiliated DJs & live music, and of
          course zesty activities all on the edge of a forest in the beautiful
          flatlands of Norfolk. Babies and young kids are also very welcome.
        </p>

        <p>
          With new site comes new opportunities - and we're very excited to say
          that comfort is being kicked up a notch this year. We will have an 8
          person sauna fired up and running all weekend. It's the real deal -
          hand built in Lithuania and run by the amazing Wondering Wild Spa
        </p>

        <p class="emoji">‚õ∫</p>

        <p>
          On top of that we also have nine 6 person glamping tents available for
          the weekend. Each tent has 1 double bed and 4 singles. They are priced
          per whole tent so you can decide the groups you want to stay with.
          We're expecting these to fly out too so grab one while you can.
        </p>

        <p class="emoji">üéüÔ∏è</p>

        <p>
          You will see that our ticket prices have increased a bit this year to
          ¬£95. This is largely due to the new site being more than double the
          cost of our previous one. Lemon Lounge has never been about making
          profits - we are purely aiming to break even, but in today‚Äôs festival
          climate it is difficult.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have held some cheaper tickets back for those that are un-waged or
          would really like to attend but the ticket price is a barrier. Please
          message us if you fall into this category
        </p>

        <p class="emoji">üå≤</p>

        <p>
          If you have joined us before, then you'll know the score as we're
          going to operate in a similar format for the weekend
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="bold">Friday</span><br />
          Gates open at 4pm. We'll arrange a big lemon pot luck feast and ask
          you to bring something to contribute if you can. We will have some
          basic reheating facilities and the theme this year is Italian!
          <br /><br />
          <span class="bold">Saturday</span><br />
          The sound system will be switched on at midday, and we‚Äôll kick off the
          various workshops and activities. We‚Äôll have our usual slew of DJs,
          and a few late night surprises if all goes to plan.
          <br /><br />
          <span class="bold">Sunday</span><br />
          Live music all day and we‚Äôre in the midst of curating our best lime-up
          yet. Please do stay for the ceremony in the evening and a final dance,
          before heading off on Monday morning.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As before, it's an intimate affair. We're only selling 200 tickets to
          keep it nice and friendly. Please send us a message if you'd like to
          come with a big group.
        </p>

        <p>
          Travel-wise, if you're driving we'll send an exact pin drop out nearer
          the time, it's in a small village near Thetford which is a 2hr 30min
          drive from SE London. Please do car share if you can!
        </p>

        <p>
          If you'll be getting the train, head to Thetford which is the nearest
          well connected station. It will be a cheap-ish taxi from there to the
          site. There is a 2 hour train from Kings Cross if you're coming from
          London.
        </p>
